Purpose
=======
After testing the engine with multiple people I realized a guide explaining what this engine does differently would help users.
That's why this **Migration Guide** now exists.

It will help you realize how this engine differs from the engine you are used to.
The goal is to teach you a new way of thinking that is more Data Oriented instead of Object Oriented which many popular programming languages and game engines are built upon.
