Rendering
=========
This is a temporary section.
We do have a rendering example available on the `rendering-reimplement branch <https://github.com/NVriezen/ZelGameEngine/tree/rendering-reimplement>`_.
This example can show you how to use the Rendering API and render a sprite. In the future we will outline everything needed for rendering.
